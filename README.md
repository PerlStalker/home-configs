home-configs
============

Configurations for various Linux apps.

This repo exists for two reasons. 1) Make it easy for me to sync my
configuration across multiple desktops. 2) Provide an example for
others.

I could be using a config management system like salt, chef or puppet
but I want to have live edit the configs and then commit the changes
directly.
